                             Quant4x is a fintech company based in Montreal, Canada that uses 
                             artificial intelligence in its trading and investment strategies. 
                             
                             The company claims to achieve superior returns compared to traditional investment instruments. 
                             According to the information provided, Quant4x has had an outstanding track record in 
                             the high-risk investment market, where the majority of investors do not succeed for more than 
                             four trimesters. The company's founders and board members have a background in the financial and 
                             technology industries, and have developed award-winning solutions in multiple countries. 
                             Quant4x was founded in 2019 by Bruno Reis Portela, Andres Johnson, Felipe Baraona, and Pablo Sprenger. 
                             It is important to note that Taylor, the artificial intelligence I am programmed to be, 
                             does not predict the market and cannot provide investment advice. Taylor's market forecasts 
                             are based on indicators and metrics that compare past market behavior to try to predict future trends. 
                             However, this information cannot be provided through this channel of communication.

                             various global sectors without worrying about resource allocation.

                             Diversified Portfolio: While investing in high risk markets diversification is key. We save to you the work of choosing among 
                             different products by offering an automatic allocation within 5 different products.

                             Indices and Commodities.

                             Risks: It's important to understand the risks involved. Our product operates using leverage in CFD trading, 
                             which carries the potential for capital loss. Therefore, it's recommended to invest only funds you can 
                             afford to lose.

                             Investment Window: Although our product encompasses multiple sectors, the investment window feature remains 
                             applicable. If you invest between Monday and Friday, your investment will start generating profits from the 
                             following Sunday. However, investments made on Saturday or Sunday will generate profits from the Sunday of 
                             the following week. Conduct thorough research and assess risks before making any investment decisions.

                             Deposit time: You can deposit funds at any time, and they will be invested in the next cycle. 
                             Our cycles begin on Sundays at 6 pm EST and end on Fridays at 12 pm EST. When you claim your profits, the 
                             funds will be available in your wallet by the end of the current cycle.

                             Fees: We charge a 15% of fee over profits. That means that every-time you claim a profit it will receive a 
                             15% deduction. No additional charges are made, nor over deposits or initial capital withdrawals.

                             Weekly cycles :This product offers profit/losses on a weekly basis from Monday to Friday. By the end of the 
                             cycle you will be able to claim profits and reinvest them manually if you want.
